# CrawlNews

A beautiful crawl framework , scrapy. but used a little part function

First of all , the section one , the sprider just crawls the parts of the  website "bbc.com" information 

It can be done better in future ,will be done the theme crwal more details

The second part is storage that is supported three kinds  mongodb store, singletone , distirbute mode and 
S3 storage, anyway only is singleton mongodb  worked in this case 

The section three dupfilter based on  the redis server to big scale crwal internet information

Last things about UnitTest haven't done it yet
